Dt228/2 OOP-Assignment 


name:Rees Ringrose
student number:C15388176

My movie device is based off star wars with a tie fighter weapon tracking system 
I guess you could call it but I basically turned it into a training simulator I hope thats okay

how it works :

you start off on the start screen and from there you have 2 options you can stay in the start screen and enjoy the music or you can press 2 and go into the game 

in the game you press the spacebar to fire and 'r' to reload you want to fire when the x-wing(enemy ship) is in the middle of the hud alligned with the 4 huge lines and fire if it is in the required distance it will fire a lazer and blow up the ship displaying that you have won the game and you can press q to go back to the menu and most of the variables will be reset 

if you fire all 10 shots and you miss everytime you will see a game over and an option to restart the game aswell and reset the variables 

inside the game you can press 3 at anytime and pause the game and press 2 to unPause it 

i think as aspect of the assignment that could be overlooked is the fact that there is only 1 image used in the sketch and that is at the intro menu plotting out the hud took me quite a while there is over a 100 lines in the hud and getting each one of them where i wanted took me forever id say most of the time I spent on this assignment was on the hud please don't overlook it i didn't want to put that much images in i wanted to make it myself and add that aspect to the project
